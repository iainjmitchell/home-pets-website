                <p>
                  Many people face the problem of what to do with their much loved pets when they are going on holiday, or have to be away for work. Pets like to be at home, so they can do their own thing, no matter how odd!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cats can find catterys stressful, and even the journey in the car to the cattery can be very stressful for them. Finding someone to look after other animals such as rabbits, chickens and guineapigs can be very difficult.
                  <b>Purrs &amp; Paws</b> provides a solution to this problem. We will come and visit your pets at home while you are away, giving them the care and attention they need.
